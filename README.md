My dotfiles settings

I suggest you to clone the repository and create a symbolic link for each file to their proper place

* On Windows, open CMD with Admin privileges and execute `mklink path/to/files/file file`
* On UNIX-ish systems, use `ln -s path/to/files/file file`

## Content

* vimrc
* profile
